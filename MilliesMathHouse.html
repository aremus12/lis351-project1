				Millie's Math House was a kids education game focused on teaching young kids math. Kids can play games that involve counting.
				<br><br>
				Upon entering Millies's house, the player will be greeted by an cow named Millie sitting on the counter of her store. The player will then be and the encouraged to explore her shop, by clicking items on her shelf. When the player clicks an item, Millie will point to it and make a snide comment. If the player doesn't click on anything, Millie will repeat her signature line, "I'm Millie! Come play in my Math House!". <br><br>
