				Welcome to the greatest archive of all time.<br> 
				<br>
				This archive is a project for my Library and Information Studies 351 class. This is my first experience with HTML and CSS. These games were my first experiences with computers in elementary school, so I thought it would only be right to document them for my most advaced computer classes in college! Without further ado, I present Early Learning House games:
				<br> <br>
				Early Learning House is a series of four "Edutainment" games developed by Theatrix Interactive, Inc in the 1990's. These games were picked up and published by Edmark. Since Theatrix Interactive went bankrupt in the early 2000's, this website will serve to preserve their epic and glorious legacy.<br><br>
